Nithya kalyani is an evergreen herbaceous plant that belongs to the Catharanthus species. Also known as rose periwinkle, nithya kalyani is distinct for its glossy, oval leaves and white, pink to purplish flowers with dark red center. This flowering shrub is endangered in the wild but is widely cultivated in tropical countries. In Asia, nithya kalyani is a mainstay in many gardens but in India, it’s been used since ancient times as medicinal herb.

Nithya kalyani contains more than 70 alkaloids, many of which are known to enhance health. The plant contains powerful vinblastine called vincristine and reserpine. Vincristine cuts the risk of cancer and reserpine lowers blood pressure.

Do note that although the herb is prized for its medicinal properties, it’s also highly toxic when consumed fresh. It has to be processed in order to enhance its efficacy in treating various illnesses.
